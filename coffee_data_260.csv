At Your Service: Coffee Beans Recommendation From a Robot Assistant,"With advances in the field of machine learning, precisely algorithms for
recommendation systems, robot assistants are envisioned to become more present
in the hospitality industry. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has also
highlighted the need to have more service robots in our everyday lives, to
minimise the risk of human to-human transmission. One such example would be
coffee shops, which have become intrinsic to our everyday lives. However,
serving an excellent cup of coffee is not a trivial feat as a coffee blend
typically comprises rich aromas, indulgent and unique flavours and a lingering
aftertaste. Our work addresses this by proposing a computational model which
recommends optimal coffee beans resulting from the user's preferences.
Specifically, given a set of coffee bean properties (objective features), we
apply different supervised learning techniques to predict coffee qualities
(subjective features). We then consider an unsupervised learning method to
analyse the relationship between coffee beans in the subjective feature space.
Evaluated on a real coffee beans dataset based on digitised reviews, our
results illustrate that the proposed computational model gives up to 92.7
percent recommendation accuracy for coffee beans prediction. From this, we
propose how this computational model can be deployed on a service robot to
reliably predict customers' coffee bean preferences, starting from the user
inputting their coffee preferences to the robot recommending the coffee beans
that best meet the user's likings.","['Jacopo de Berardinis', 'Gabriella Pizzuto', 'Francesco Lanza', 'Antonio Chella', 'Jorge Meira', 'Angelo Cangelosi']","At Your Service: Coffee Beans Recommendation From a Robot Assistant. With advances in the field of machine learning, precisely algorithms for

Coffee Roast Intelligence,"As the coffee industry has grown, there would be more demand for roasted
coffee beans, as well as increased rivalry for selling coffee and attracting
customers. As the flavor of each variety of coffee is dependent on the degree
of roasting of the coffee beans, it is vital to maintain a consistent quality
related to the degree of roasting. Each barista has their own method for
determining the degree of roasting. However, extrinsic circumstances such as
light, fatigue, and other factors may alter their judgment. As a result, the
quality of the coffee cannot be controlled. The Coffee Roast Intelligence
application is a machine learning-based study of roasted coffee bean degrees
classification produced as an Android application platform that identifies the
color of coffee beans by photographing or uploading them while roasting. This
application displays the text showing at what level the coffee beans have been
roasted, as well as informs the percent chance of class prediction to the
consumers. Users may also keep track of the result of the predictions related
to the roasting level of coffee beans.","['Sakdipat Ontoum', 'Thitaree Khemanantakul', 'Pornphat Sroison', 'Tuul Triyason', 'Bunthit Watanapa']","Coffee Roast Intelligence. As the coffee industry has grown, there would be more demand for roasted

"Infection model for analyzing biological control of coffee rust using
  bacterial anti-fungal compounds","Coffee rust is one of the main diseases that affect coffee plantations
worldwide. This causes an important economic impact in the coffee production
industry in countries where coffee is an important part of the economy. A
common method for combating this disease is using copper hydroxide as a
fungicide, which can have damaging effects both on the coffee tree and on human
health. A novel method for biological control of coffee rust using bacteria has
been proven to be an effective alternative to copper hydroxide fungicides as
anti-fungal compounds. In this paper, we develop and explore a spatial
stochastic model for this interaction in a coffee plantation. We analyze
equilibria for specific control strategies, as well as compute the basic
reproductive number, R0, of individual coffee trees, conditions for local and
global stability under specific conditions, parameter estimation of key
parameters, as well as sensitivity analysis, and numerical experiments under
local and global control strategies for key scenarios.","['Jorge Arroyo Esquivel', 'Fabio Sanchez', 'Luis Barboza']","Infection model for analyzing biological control of coffee rust using

"Identifying Optimal Market Choices to Increase the Profitability of
  Coffee Farmers in Sultan Kudarat through Modeling and Scenario Analysis","This study focuses on the coffee chain of Sultan Kudarat - the coffee capital
of the Philippines, where most of the farmers are smallholders. Coffee farmers
in this area allocate their harvested cherries as fresh cherries, dried
cherries, and green coffee beans to five market outlets: Nestle Philippines,
local traders, association, direct selling, and other markets not mentioned
(e.g., coffee shops and hotels). Hence, a supply chain network design (SCND)
model and simulation are developed to investigate the changes in the profits of
coffee farmers as they market their products, whether to be sold as fresh
cherries, dried cherries, or processed into green coffee beans before marketing
to the market outlets mentioned above, based on the average annual costs
affecting the production, primary processing, and market prices of coffee
products. Assuming that the annual coffee yield per tree and the average prices
of coffee products in different markets are constant, the simulations show that
farmers can gain a positive annual profit if they sell all dried cherries.
However, results show that if farmers decide to produce and sell all green
coffee beans, the farmers gain a negative profit due to the additional annual
average dehulling cost and the minimal difference in average selling prices
between dried cherries and green coffee beans in different markets.
Furthermore, members of the association producing dried cherries can gain by
allocating the required 70 percent of their product to the association and 30
percent to the other markets. In contrast, selling 30 percent of green coffee
beans to any market generates a negative profit. The developed model can also
be modified and used for regular coffee farms and other commodities.","['Novy Aila B. Rivas', 'Giovanna Fae R. Oguis', 'Alex John C. Labanon', 'El Veena Grace A. Rosero', 'Jon Henly O. Santillan', 'Larry N. Digal']","Identifying Optimal Market Choices to Increase the Profitability of

"Annihilative fractals of coffee on milk formed by Rayleigh-Taylor
  instability","We have discovered a new fractal pattern, coffee exhibits on a horizontal
surface, with a fractal dimension $1.88 \pm 0.06$, when a heavy coffee droplet
interacts with the surface of lighter milk. Parts of coffee pattern on the
surface disappear due to Rayleigh-Taylor instability, and the annihilative
behavior produces the fractal pattern. Coffee fractals and the Sierpinski
carpet have common features, such as the fractal dimension, annihilative
behavior, and an exponential decrease of the pattern area. It is suggested the
formation of fractal follows a rule similar to that of the Sierpinski carpet.","['Michiko Shimokawa', 'Shonosuke Ohta']","Annihilative fractals of coffee on milk formed by Rayleigh-Taylor

"Exploring the link between coffee matrix microstructure and flow
  properties using combined X-ray microtomography and smoothed particle
  hydrodynamics simulations","Coffee extraction involves many complex physical and transport processes
extremely difficult to model. Among the many factors that will affect the final
quality of coffee, the microstructure of the coffee matrix is one of the most
critical ones. In this article, we use X-ray micro-computed (microCT) technique
to capture the microscopic details of coffee matrices at particle-level and
perform fluid dynamics simulation based on the smoothed particle hydrodynamics
method (SPH) with the 3D reconstructured data. Information like flow
permeability and tortuosity of the matrices can be therefore obtained from our
simulation. We found that inertial effects can be quite significant at the
normal pressure gradient conditions typical for espresso brewing, and can
provide an explanation for the inconsistency of permeability measurements seen
in the literature. Several types of coffee powder are further examined,
revealing their distinct microscopic details and resulting flow features. By
comparing the microCT images of pre- and post-extraction coffee matrices, it is
found that a decreasing porosity profile (from the bottom-outlet to the
top-inlet) always develops after extraction. This counterintuitive phenomenon
can be explained using a pressure-dependent erosion model proposed in our prior
work. Our results show that microCT scan can provide useful microscopic details
for coffee extraction modelling and establish the basis for a data-driven
numerical framework to explore the link between coffee powder microstructure
and extraction dynamics. The latter is the prerequisite to study the time
evolution of both volatile and non-volatile organic compounds and then the
flavour profile of coffee brews.","['Chaojie Mo', 'Richard Johnston', 'Luciano Navarini', 'Furio Suggi Liverani', 'Marco Ellero']","Exploring the link between coffee matrix microstructure and flow

Economical-Epidemiological Analysis of the Coffee Trees Rust Pandemic,"Coffee leaf rust is a prevalent botanical disease that causes a worldwide
reduction in coffee supply and its quality, leading to immense economic losses.
While several pandemic intervention policies (PIPs) for tackling this rust
pandemic are commercially available, they seem to provide only partial
epidemiological relief for farmers. In this work, we develop a high-resolution
economical-epidemiological model that captures the rust pandemic's spread in
coffee tree farms and its associated economic impact. Through extensive
simulations for the case of Colombia, a country that consists mostly of
small-size coffee farms and is the second-largest coffee producer in the world,
our results show that it is economically impractical to sustain any profit
without directly tackling the rust pandemic. Furthermore, even in the
hypothetical case where farmers perfectly know their farm's epidemiological
state and the weather in advance, any rust pandemic-related efforts can only
amount to a limited profit of roughly 4% on investment. In the more realistic
case, any rust pandemic-related efforts are expected to result in economic
losses, indicating that major disturbances in the coffee market are
anticipated.","['Teddy Lazebnik', 'Ariel Rosenfeld', 'Labib Shami']","Economical-Epidemiological Analysis of the Coffee Trees Rust Pandemic. Coffee leaf rust is a prevalent botanical disease that causes a worldwide
